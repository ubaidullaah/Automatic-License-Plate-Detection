# Cars_License_plate_detection The link for this dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection.
In this project YOLOV8 is used for Object detection. I have trained custom dataset on top of YOLO for automatic detection of the cars license plates.
The YOLOV8 is trained on 100 epochs to achieve map 0.5-0.7 .
The deployment of project is done using Streamlit.
